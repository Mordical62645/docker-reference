Think of a project like a toy set that your friend built.
You don’t know how they made it, you just know:
1. What pieces they used (their files, dependencies).
2. How it’s supposed to work when you play with it (commands to run it).

Containerizing is like putting their toy into a clear plastic box 
so that no matter where you take it—your house, your cousin’s, 
or school—it will look and work exactly the same.

So even if you didn’t build the toy, you can still box it up if you:

1. Ask for the recipe. It tells you what ingredients (dependencies) the project needs.
This is usually in files like:

DOCUMENTATION:
* README.md/README.txt (main instructions)
* INSTALL.md (installation guide)
* docs/ folder (detailed documentation)

LANGUAGE DEPENDENCIES:
* Python: requirements.txt, Pipfile, pyproject.toml, setup.py, environment.yml, poetry.lock
* Node.js: package.json, package-lock.json, yarn.lock, pnpm-lock.yaml, .nvmrc
* PHP: composer.json, composer.lock
* Ruby: Gemfile, Gemfile.lock, .ruby-version
* Go: go.mod, go.sum, vendor/ folder
* Java: pom.xml (Maven), build.gradle (Gradle), ivy.xml
* C#/.NET: *.csproj, *.sln, packages.config
* Rust: Cargo.toml, Cargo.lock
* Swift: Package.swift, Package.resolved
* R: DESCRIPTION, renv.lock
* Julia: Project.toml, Manifest.toml

FRONTEND/WEB:
* webpack.config.js, vite.config.js, rollup.config.js
* angular.json, vue.config.js, next.config.js, svelte.config.js
* gulpfile.js, grunt.js

CONFIGURATION:
* .env files (environment variables)
* config/ folder, settings.json, appsettings.json
* .ini, .yaml, .yml, .toml files
* Makefile, CMakeLists.txt

DATABASE/DATA:
* migrations/, db/migrate/ (database migrations)
* seeds/, fixtures/ (database seed data)
* schema.sql, *.sql files
* database.yml, db.json
* CSV, JSON, XML data files the app needs

STATIC ASSETS/MEDIA (YES, these ARE dependencies!):
* Images: *.png, *.jpg, *.jpeg, *.gif, *.svg, *.ico, *.webp
* Videos: *.mp4, *.avi, *.mov, *.webm, *.mkv
* Audio: *.mp3, *.wav, *.ogg, *.m4a
* Fonts: *.ttf, *.otf, *.woff, *.woff2
* CSS/Styles: *.css, *.scss, *.sass, *.less
* Static folders: public/, static/, assets/, media/

CONTAINER/DEPLOYMENT:
* Dockerfile, Dockerfile.*, docker-compose.yml
* .dockerignore
* k8s/, kubernetes/ folders
* terraform/, ansible/

CI/CD:
* .github/workflows/ (GitHub Actions)
* .gitlab-ci.yml, Jenkinsfile, .travis.yml

DEVELOPMENT TOOLS:
* .editorconfig, .prettierrc
* eslint.json, tslint.json
* jest.config.js, .babelrc
* tsconfig.json, jsconfig.json

MOBILE:
* Android: build.gradle, gradle.properties
* iOS: Podfile, Podfile.lock
* Flutter: pubspec.yaml, pubspec.lock
* React Native: metro.config.js

2. Find the “start button”. This will be the CMD or ENTRYPOINT in your Dockerfile.
Figure out how to start the app:
* Python -> python main.py
* Node.js -> npm start
* PHP -> php artisan serve


3. Write the box instructions (Dockerfile)
* Pick a base image (Python, Node, etc.).
* Copy the files in.
* Install the dependencies.
* Tell it what command to run.

4. Write a docker-compose.yml
If the app needs multiple toys in the same box (like app + database), 
Compose is like a multi-compartment box.

5. Test the box 
Run docker build, docker run, or docker-compose up --build to make sure it works exactly like they want.

If you do this process in every project, you don’t need to be part of development.
You just need to:
1. Get the recipe
2. Find the start button
3. Make a box that runs it anywhere
